      Over the summer of 2025, I built a robot from scratch 
     with three of my classmates in about three weeks. 
     I learned so much about the general design process for 
     a project, as well as prototyping, circuit and PCB design, 
     embedded progamming, control systems, and more. Related links and articles can be found below.
