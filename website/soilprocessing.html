        Soil processing system

    <p>
        I'm currently designing a system that autonomously prepares 
        soil samples for analysis onboard a rover for the URC (University Rover Competition). 
        It is part of my role on the UBC Rover Design team. I've been learning about cell lysis methods and their
        practicality in this context and working on preliminary CAD and concept generation so far.
